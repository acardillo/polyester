# Project: Polystore Retrieval System

## Context
This is an AI engineering project comparing vector, graph, and hybrid retrieval architectures across different data domains (Python docs + music metadata).

## Code Standards
- Use type hints on all functions
- Follow Google-style docstrings
- Format with Black (line length 100)
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use Pydantic for all data models
- Abstract base classes for extensibility

## Architecture Patterns
- DataAdapter: transforms raw data → Documents (swappable domains)
- MemoryStore: storage/retrieval backend (swappable implementations)
- Query engine orchestrates adapter + store
- Config-driven (YAML files for different setups)

## When Helping Me
1. Explain what we're building and why before showing code
2. Show the pattern/structure first
3. Let me implement
4. Review and suggest improvements
5. Keep focus on learning + portfolio quality

## Current Phase
Check commit history or ask me where we are in the week plan.
