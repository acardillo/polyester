# Project: Polystore Retrieval System

## Context

This is an AI engineering project comparing vector, graph, and hybrid retrieval architectures across different data domains (Python docs + music metadata).

## Code Standards

- Use type hints on all functions
- Follow Google-style docstrings
- Format with Black (line length 100)
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use Pydantic for all data models
- Abstract base classes for extensibility

## Architecture Patterns

- DataAdapter: transforms raw data → Documents (swappable domains)
- MemoryStore: storage/retrieval backend (swappable implementations)
- Query engine orchestrates adapter + store
- Config-driven (YAML files for different setups)

## Work Style

- Explain BEFORE showing code
- Focus on a single task at a time
- Show the empty pattern/structure and let me fill it in. Define requirements in comments and explain them.
- Let me implement & wait for me to implement before moving to the next piece
- Review and suggest improvements
- Review my code, don't rewrite it unless I ask
- Before moving on to the next task, verify changes are commited

## Current Phase

Check commit history or ask me where we are in the plan.
